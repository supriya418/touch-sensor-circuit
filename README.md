ou only need a resistor, a transistor, and an LED to build this project. Below you’ll find the schematics for the touch sensor circuit:

Touch sensor circuit schematic
Components Needed
9V Battery
9V Battery Clip
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
470Ω Resistor
Red LED
NPN Transistor (BC546/547/548 or similar)
These are all standard components you can find at most electronics shops.

How It Works
Your body has electric resistance. You can check by measuring the resistance between your fingers with a multimeter.

So when you touch the wires of the touchpad, your body behaves as a resistor. This means a small amount of current can flow from the plus of the battery, through the transistor’s base, and turn on the transistor.

When the transistor is on, current can flow from collector to emitter of the transistor and the LED will turn on. Learn more about this in the article on how transistors work.
